This is a test of Mark updating the NewFile.txt file and to test the merge process. 

This is an update done by creating a new BRANCH. (MarkFeatureAddBranch) This file is in the newly created branch then editing directly in GitHub.

Once these updates are completed, I'll merge the branch back back into the MASTER branch.

Step 1 - Commit the changes...
Step 2 - Try to remember the hello-world demo done yesterday.
